<p>Subject: Support for Hong Kong</p>

<p>Dear Name,</p>

<p>Over the past couple of months, Hong Kong residents have fought for
their rights against an ever increasing political pressure from mainland
China. As a Canadian MP, I wanted to know if you personally support the
democratic movement in Hong Kong today, even if it’s not something you
can really affect.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, and do let me know.</p>

<p>Subject: Support for Hong Kong</p>

<p>Dear Name,</p>

<p>On March 31st, 7 months ago, the Civil Human Rights Front in Hong Kong launched their first protest against an extradition bill that they feared would allow them to disappear into the night, much like the infamous Causeway Bay Books disappearance cases from 2015. These protests, while initially supported and protected by the government like in Canada, were soon met with increasingly resilient force by the Hong Kong government and severe crackdowns and arrests were soon made.</p>

<p>As a Canadian Member of Parliament, I was wondering if you personally support the Hong Kong protests, and condone the use of escalating violence at the scene.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your time, and I hope to hear back from you soon;</p>

<p>My Name</p>

<hr />

<p> </p>

<p>By the way! While you’re here, I just want to thank you for your support. It’s hard to support countries far away, but together, we can build up and the change. Thank you!!</p>
