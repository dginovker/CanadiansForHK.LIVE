CanadaHongKong is a website for Canadians to help support the Hong Kong freedom movement. It relies on its users to contact Canadian MPs and reach out to the website owners so we can update the page. Want to help with the site? Check us out on [Github](https://github.com/CanadaHongKong).

Got an update from an MP? Reach out to me! Tell me who you contacted and what their status is: [dcress01@uoguelph.ca](mailto:dcress01@uoguelph.ca)
