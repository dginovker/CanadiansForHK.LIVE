Here's an email I sent out to my MP:

*****

Subject: Support for Hong Kong

Dear Name,


Over the past couple of months, Hong Kong residents have fought for
their rights against an ever increasing political pressure from mainland
China. As a Canadian MP, I wanted to know if you personally support the
democratic movement in Hong Kong today, even if it's not something you
can really affect.


Thank you for your time, and do let me know.

My Name

*****

By the way! While you're here, I just want to thank you for your support. It's hard to support countries far away, but together, we can build up and the change. Thank you!!
